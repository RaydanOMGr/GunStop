# GunStop
This plugin (GunStop) is made for my Minecraft Server. It adds various kinds of guns.

# Configuration
This plugin doesn't have a big config. Here is the default config:
```yml
whitelist:
- world
```
It should be self-explainatory, but if you still don't understand, those are the whitelisted worlds, the worlds the plugin works in. In the world, mobs don't drop anything (exp, loot) and the stone shovel is a gun, the only gun right now.

# Guns
Since this is a plugin about guns, this plugin has guns. Currently there are 3 guns. 
1. The Stone Shovel which is the Desert Eagle .50 cal AE. Magazine: 4 bullets, 3 second reload in-between bullets. Reload of the whole magazine: 15 seconds
2. The Wooden Shovel which is a Rocket Launcher. No magazine. Reload of the gun: 15 seconds
3. The Wooden Hoe which is the AK 47. Magazine: 75 bullets, 1/10th of a second reload in-between bullets. Reload of the whole magazine: 20 seconds
4. The Golden Shovel which is the Quad Rocket Launcher. Magazine: 4 bullets, 1.5 second reload in-between bullets. Reload of the whole magazine: 50 seconds
5. The Stone Hoe which is the AWP Sniper Rifle. No magazine. Reload of the gun: 13 seconds
