# GunStop
This plugin (GunStop) is made for my Minecraft Server. If you need it you can take and modify the source code. I don't care, publish it as your own plugin or something. If you do that tho, I would appreciate if you left a little credit, but you don't have to

# Configuration
This plugin doesn't have a big config. Here is the default config:
```yml
whitelist:
- world
```
It should be self-explainatory, but if you still don't understand, those are the whitelisted worlds, the worlds the plugin works in. In the world, mobs don't drop anything (exp, loot) and the stone shovel is a gun, the only gun right now.

# Guns
Since this is a plugin about guns, this plugin has guns. Currently there are 3 guns. 
1. The Stone Shovel which is the Desert Eagle .50 cal AE.
2. The Wooden Shovel which is the RPG
3. The Wooden Hoe which is the AK 47
